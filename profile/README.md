# ForestPulse

This organization serves as open and transparent development hub for the ForestPulse project.

## Some rules

- @ all project members: Do not post or include any data or information that should stay disclosed!
- repositories should generally be public. Only private when really(!) needed, we aim at open development.
- Push often!
